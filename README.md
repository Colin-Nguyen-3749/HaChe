# HaChe

This repository contains the code for a HaChe website, which should include:
- Introduction to HaChe
- Who the founders are
- Workers?
- Ingredients/how it's made
- Link to HaChe game!
- Dataset?

Perhaps we should also consider making a data optimization shiny app like Vidit did for DA 353 final project, where our goal is to optimize income with constraints on budget and ingredient amount.
